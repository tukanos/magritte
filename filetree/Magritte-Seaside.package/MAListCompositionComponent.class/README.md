I'm, like MACheckboxComponent, a seaside component for MAMultipleSelectionDescription. I display two lists. In the first, all available options, in the other, what the user selected. 2 buttons in between to add and remove elements to/from the selected list. If the everything property is set, I display two more buttons to allow the user to add or remove all options in one click.
